# About the code

We provide the input tests, the logic that parses them and the checker that runs them.

* test_db - contains the tests in JSON format
* src
   * checker - the checker's sources including the checkstyle necessary files, not to be modified
   * fileio - classes for parsing the input files, not to be modified
   * common, utils
        * contain utility classes with constants and static methods
        * you can add your own functionality in the existing classes or add new classes as well
   * actor
        * contains an enum for the types of awards an actor can have - do not modify it
        * you can add here your actor related classes
   * entertainment
        * contains an enum for the supported video genres - do not modify it
        * class for representing a Season of a tv show - do not modify it
        * you can add here your entertainment related classes

We encourage you to organize your implementation in packages based on the functionality their classes offer. Try to keep
your code modular, readable and documented.

# Testing

The Main class runs the checker on your implementation. Add the entry point to your implementation in it.

Run Main to test your implementation from the IDE or from command line.

Run the main method from Test class with the name of the input file from the command line and the result will be written
to the out.txt file. Thus, you can compare this result with ref.
